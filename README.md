# Data-Science-Assignment
This project aims to perform customer segmentation by applying K-Means clustering on customer profile and transaction data. By analyzing customer purchasing behaviors and demographic information, we can identify distinct customer segments. This can help businesses target specific customer groups with personalized marketing strategies.

**Project Structure:
Customers.csv: Contains customer profile information (e.g., customer ID, name, region, signup date).
Transactions.csv: Contains transaction data (e.g., transaction ID, product ID, customer ID, quantity, total value).
Clustering Notebook: Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis, from data preprocessing to clustering and evaluation.
Clustered_Customers.csv: CSV file with the customer IDs and their corresponding cluster labels.
